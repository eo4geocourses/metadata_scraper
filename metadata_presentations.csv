In SDI several technical and non-technical components work together. This module focuses on the non-technical components and is targeting decision makers, managers and process owners.
		The module starts with a general introduction to Spatial Data Infrastructures, followed by several lectures on specific non-technological aspects and components of SDIs. The module looks at the legal framework of SDIs, and the relevance and importance of data policies, and open data policies in particular. It addresses governance and task allocation in the context of SDIs, by explaining the meaning of both concepts and presenting approaches for governing and allocating tasks in the development and implementation of SDIs. The module also looks at SDIs from a process perspective, as processes are key to the development and use of SDIs. The final part of the module deals with the assessment and evaluation of SDIs, i.e. how to measure and manage the performance of SDIs.
