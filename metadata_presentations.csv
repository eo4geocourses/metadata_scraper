https://eo4geocourses.github.io/KULeuven_Technical-Introduction-to-SDI/,True,Training module on SDI Architecture and SDI components,-----,"Spatial data are widely used in public and private organisations. However, the data are often difficult to find, access, use and combine. Spatial data infrastructures (SDI) are a solution to this lack of accessibility and interoperability. An SDI is a set of technological and non-technological components meant to facilitate access, exchange and re-use of geospatial data within and between organisations.The module introduces the concept of SDIs and explains the rationale behind it. It explains the  different technical and non-technical components of an SDI: data, services, metadata, standards, technology, organisational and institutional aspects (people), etc. and how the technological components work together. The module discusses also what SDI are used for, i.e. what are the objectives of a good functioning SDI.. The components and the benefits of an SDI are illustrated using real world examples. The access to SDIs through geoportals is demonstrated. Learners will visit several geoportals and will learn to browse for data.The training material consist of presentations, exercises and supporting documents. The module is NOT a self-learning module, but needs class tutoring and interactions.",Learning outcomes:To describe and explain the rationale and concepts of SDIs; To explain the requirements for building a successful SDI;to recognise and describe the different components of an SDI; To explain how these components work together in an SDI; To explain how geoportals are a user interface to SDIs and their specific functions; To identify the benefits of an SDI for her/his organisation; To search and find specific datasets,------,2020-08-04,"['TA7-5-1', 'TA7-5-2', 'GS3']",EN
