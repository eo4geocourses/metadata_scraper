# Metadata Scraper  
Check out the **automatically** [updated table](https://eo4geocourses.github.io/metadata_scraper/).


This little script takes the EO4GEO course list and extracts the metadata for each course. The CSV file, table and index.html file are **automatically updated every night at 03:00am.**  The table this script produces can be used to assess any updates to which courses have already been changed from the template and which remain unchanged.
  
The index.html file contains a modified table of the csv in order to more quickly show which information is present. The extracted information itself is written into the metadata_presentations.csv file.
  
  
The following information is extracted per course:  
  
* title
* creator
* abstract
* description
* contributor
* created
* relation
* language
